<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><b>mavencrm</b> is a CRM and an applications container solution forked from <a href="https://github.com/VTECRM/vtenext">vtenext</a> which is based on vTigerCRM and sugarCRM.</p>
<p><b>mavencrm</b> re-imagines the product with changes to the core design focusing on enhancing the user experience, performance and flexibility of the product and taking it to a new level.</p>
<br>
<h2>Yet another CRM product !?</h2>

<b> ABSOLUTELY !!</b> and the reason is simple: CRM is still the most important domain for any size business, yet at the same time the most complex and under-utilised domain in the world! It is a must for any size organisation, though you may rightly think the market is saturated with CRM products, the CRM market leaders fall short in user adoption and usage due to implementation costs and complexity. 

<p>
Frustrated by the shortfalls of CRM market leaders and building upon 25 years of experience in the CRM space prompted us to make a fresh new research of the CRM market seeking an affordable, feature-rich, easily adoptable, hackable, versatile, modular, business-process driven, easy-to-use, integrate-with-anything, data-centric solution for every size business!
</p>

<p>
We made a decision to focus our research and development to build upon <b>VTENEXT</b>, an Open Source CRM solution offering the latest innovative tools powered by a BPMN engine. <b>VTENEXT</b> is originally a fork of <b>vTigerCRM</b> which is a well-tested and proven CRM solution, and the addition of a fully integrated BPMN engine allows unprecendented orchestration of any company process in an advanced way.
<p>

<p>

  <b>mavencrm</b> has taken the best parts of <b>VTENEXT</b> and use it to address the project's core objectives. The new solution and deployment architecture takes advantage of the modular design of VTENEXT and integrates some of the most amazing open source products out there to achieve the goal of an all-in-one information managment system. We Think <b>big</b> and act small.
