    longDescription: >
      **vtenext** is a **unique open source solution.**  In addition to the
      usual CRM functions for the management of marketing,  sales and
      after-sales processes, it can also be used to offer end  customers service
      and support in a very short, certain time. All of this  is possible
      because **automated corporate process flows**  can be designed through the
      Process Manager. Each customer query is  transformed into an action
      designed not only to meet but also anticipate  specific requirements.


      Thanks to vtenextâ€™s CRM  functions you will be able to read and interpret
      historical corporate  data and create new targeted strategies. The BPM
      (Business Process  Management) engine provides for the optimization,
      automation and  repeatability of any type of process associated with
      organization,  service and customer satisfaction in general.
       Internal processes optimized with vtenext become faster and more  efficient because flows are automated, become repeatable and are  constantly monitored, so the entire organization can focus on the actual  requirements of its customers.
