. deleting a projectTask in vte doesn't delete the related tickets, whereas in jira issues are deleted
. in jira issue statuses can be different for each project, in vte they are always the same

. Removing a contact from a Target is not propagated to the VTE and viceversa


Vtiger:
. Ticket comments are not supported
. html descriptions are not supported
. some modules in vtiger have more required fields, so the sync will fail if they are not populated in vte

Performance improvements
========================

HubSpot:
. synchronize contacts-targets with list of ids, not one by one
. synchronize contacts-targets using a date of last sync, not all of them
